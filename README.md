# MontyHall
Simulates a generalized Monty Hall problem

I recommend the Jupyter Notebook experience, and all the code is available in
MontyHall.ipynb, to be edited and executed at your convenience.

If you prefer a scripted version, or just want to use the classes in another
environment, you can use montyhall.py as module. The 'run.py' script will then let you
operate on the command line.
